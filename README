VirtualBox Snapshot Deletion GUI

The VirtualBox front-end currently only allows deletion of one snapshot at a time.  This is tedious for machines that have accumulated many snapshots and where you want to delete a series of older ones.  This tool allows you to select multiple snapshots for a given machine and delete them.  It will then go and delete them in sequence.
